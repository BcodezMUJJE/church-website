          Lighthouse Grace Church/Ministries, a vibrant non-denominational
          Christian community, has been illuminating the lives of individuals
          and families in Kampala for the past 8 years. Rooted in the principles
          of the National Fellowship for Born Again Pentecostal Churches of
          Uganda and under the guidance of Grace Redeemed Ministries, the church
          has become a beacon of hope, spiritual renewal, and community
          transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded by the dedicated leadership of Steven and Brenda, Lighthouse
          Grace Church/Ministries has grown into a thriving congregation of over
          350 members across four locations. The church's missional family
          gatherings, held every Wednesday, attract a larger community of over
          900 individuals seeking spiritual guidance and support.
        </p>
        <h2>A Family-Centered Approach</h2>
        <p>
          At the heart of Lighthouse Grace Church/Ministries lies a strong
          emphasis on family. The church believes in creating a nurturing
          environment where individuals can grow spiritually, socially, and
          economically. Through missional families, or home cells, the church
          fosters deep connections among members, providing a space for
          discipleship, encouragement, and support.
        </p>
        <h2>Impacting the Community</h2>
        <p>
          The church has made a significant impact on its community through
          various ministries and initiatives. The Leadership Academy equips
          individuals with the skills and knowledge to become effective leaders,
          while the Children's Ministry provides spiritual guidance, education,
          and sponsorship to young people. The Family and Marriage Ministry
          offers counseling, support, and resources to strengthen families and
          relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, Lighthouse Grace Church/Ministries is actively involved
          in business development and employment linkages, empowering community
          members to achieve economic stability. The church's missional outreach
          extends beyond its local community, with initiatives focused on
          spreading the gospel and making a positive impact on the world.
        </p>

          their mission of discipling individuals, planting life-giving churches,
          and catalyzing spiritual renewal. To achieve this vision, the church
          has identified several key needs:
